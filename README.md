# Hello, I'm Fernando Lopez

**Junior Computer Science Student @ UIC | Software Engineer**

Honestly, I'm just a huge nerd who loves volleyball, anime, games, and code.

If I'm not at my desk, I'm usually diving on the court playing Volleyball (I play Libero), gaming, or binge-watching anime. Link Click is absolute peak anime, and I am currently suffering while waiting for the next season of Jujutsu Kaisen.

When I *am* at my desk, I get pretty obsessed with coding. I'm that person who finishes a project, looks at it, and thinks, *"Okay, but what if I added this one specific thing?"* Next thing I know, it's 3 AM and I'm adding small features just because it's fun to see it get better. As a matter of fact my latest revision is at 12:30pm beyond midnight!!

My goal is to just keep leveling up as a developer—whether that's building full-stack apps or messing around with low-level systems programming.

### What I'm Working On
- **NASA Lunabotics Team**: I'm on the Control Systems team, using C++ and ROS to help design a lunar robot for the Artemis Mission.
- **Smart Notes App**: A cross-platform app I'm building that handles 20,000+ daily edits. I worked on the C++ logic to make sure data syncs perfectly with Firebase.
- **Mentorship**: I help mentor students through the *Women in Computer Science* program, teaching them how to build and deploy their own websites.

### Featured Project: Digital Art Watermark
**Verifiable Permission System (In Progress)**
*   **The Goal**: I'm currently engineering a secure full-stack system (React/Django) to protect digital art and verify usage permissions.
*   **The Cool Part**: It's not just a CRUD app. I'm implementing advanced data structures like **Merkle Trees**, **Tries**, and **Bloom Filters** to make the verification tamper-proof.
*   **The Challenge**: I'm working on optimizing image hash lookups to run in **O(log n)** time. It's been really fun combining web development with low-level algorithmic optimization!
