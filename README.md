# Hello, I'm Fernando Lopez

**Software Engineer | Junior Computer Science Student @ UIC**

I really love to code and improve upon myself.

Ever since I was younger, I've been obsessed with improvement. I love the feeling of finishing a project, stepping back, and being proud of it—but almost immediately thinking, *"I could add this feature to make it even better."* Next thing I know, I'm staying up late just to add that one small detail.

My goal is to become a top-tier Full-Stack and Systems Engineer by constantly building, learning, and iterating.

### 🔭 What I'm Working On
- **NASA Lunabotics Team**: I'm on the Control Systems team, using C++ and ROS to help design a lunar robot for the Artemis Mission.
- **Smart Notes App**: A cross-platform app I'm building that handles 20,000+ daily edits. I worked on the C++ logic to make sure data syncs perfectly with Firebase.
- **Mentorship**: I love helping others learn, so I mentor students through the *Women in Computer Science* program, helping them deploy their own websites.

### 🛠 Tech Stack
*   **Languages**: C++, Python, JavaScript, Go, Dart, SQL
*   **Tools**: React, Flutter, Django, ROS, Firebase, Linux
*   **Concepts**: Systems Programming, Algorithms, Data Structures

### 🚀 Featured Hackathon Project
**[UIC Registration Page Redesign](https://github.com/IsaChen123/UICRegistration)**
*   **Context**: 24-Hour Hackathon
*   **The Project**: We were given a prompt to "take something and make it better." My team decided to fix the UIC Registration Page because it was a common complaint among students!
*   **My Role**: We focused on fixing the UI/UX to make it responsive and accessible, while keeping the styling familiar. It was a great experience in rapid teamwork and problem-solving.
