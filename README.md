# Hi!! I'm Fernando Lopez!!

I'm a **Junior Computer Science student at UIC** ('26) who lives by the philosophy of constant improvement. There's nothing quite like the excitement of finishing a complex project—except the immediate urge to jump back in and add a "small" feature that makes it exponentially better! My long-term goal is to master the full stack, turning ambitious ideas into polished, scalable applications.

I'm currently putting my engineering skills to work on an incredible challenge as a core member of the **NASA Lunabotics 2026 Challenge, UIC Team** building a a simulated NASA robot!!

## My Projects!!

I believe the best way to learn is to build and thus I have created these projects!!

### Notes App: Scaling Data with C++ & Firebase
* **The Goal:** Develop a responsive, cross-platform note-taking MVP using **Flutter and Dart** that could handle serious data volume.
* **The Tech:** Leveraged **C++** to efficiently manage data conversion (maps to objects) and utilized **Firebase Database** for robust data persistence.
* **The Result:** Built a scalable architecture using O-O principles, designed to handle functionality for up to **20,000 edits daily** with seamless synchronization.

### Dulce Tentaciones: Full-Feature React Site
* **The Goal:** Deliver a modern, multi-page frontend for a local startup bakery.
* **The Tech:** Built 5 core pages using **React** and created a dynamic content pipeline by integrating the **Sanity API** for client-side management.
* **The Impact:** Established core marketing functions by integrating **Brevo** for newsletters and **EmailJS** to process up to **1,000 form submissions** per month.

### UIC Registration Page: Hackathon UX/UI Overhaul
* **The Goal:** Redesign a highly-complained-about system—the UIC Registration page—in a 24-hour hackathon, competing against 15 other teams.
* **The Tech:** Used **JavaScript, HTML, and CSS** to focus on user experience and accessibility.
* **The Result:** Designed a user-friendly, intuitive layout while maintaining the original design language. **[View the Project on GitHub](https://github.com/IsaChen123/UICRegistration)**

## Leadership & Professional Focus

### NASA Lunabotics 2026 Challenge, UIC Team (Sep 2025 - Present)
* **Computer Science Member** on an engineering design team developing a lunar robot prototype for the Artemis Mission.
* My focus includes researching **LiDaR** for visual terrain mapping and initiating the software architecture for control logic and a data transmission system optimized for the competition's strict **4 kbps restriction** (using H.265 encoding).
* Applied **NASA systems engineering principles** by participating in the System Requirements Review (SRR).

### Aspire To Inspire Mentor (Sep 2025 - Present)
* Guidance and mentorship for two mentees in the Women in Computer Science organization.
* I share resources, offer one-on-one advice on course selection and career opportunities, and help build confidence in navigating academic challenges.
